            Project Description:

        </h1>
        <p>
            This interactive sketchpad project allows users to draw by hovering over a grid of squares, simulating an
            Etch-A-Sketch.
            The grid is dynamically generated with JavaScript, using Flexbox for layout, and responds to mouse events to
            create a pixelated trail.
            A button prompts users to enter a new grid size (up to 100x100), which replaces the existing grid
            essentially changing how thick the "brush" looks. For example a grid of 20x20 would produce lines thicker
            than a grid of 50x50.
            The project emphasizes DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive layout using only HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. This project is not optimised for a moblie experience, so I would recommend looking at it on a
            PC.
